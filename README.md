# CardGameH19CSharp
Implementation of High or Low using classes and writing player stats to a local file

Assignment to be completed during a  Christmas/NewYear break from the 3 month Academy program. We were given general guidelines
for what classes we should use(their names and what they should represent), but all logical code is selfwritten in order to create a
console application for a card game: Higher or Lower.
